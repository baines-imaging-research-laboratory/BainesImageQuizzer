This folder holds any scripts referenced in the 'Option' tag of a 'Button' type of 'Question'.
The script will be run when the user presses the button in the quiz.

The Option element within a Button-type question specifies the relative path with respect to this directory.
If you need a script to execute in an alternate folder, you'll need to create a script that redirects to the desired location
and initiates execution.
