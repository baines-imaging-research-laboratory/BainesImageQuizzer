Release Notes

Image Quizzer v2.1.1
	Baines Imaging Lab, LRCP, London Health Sciences Centre, London, ON, Canada

Requirements:
	3D Slicer v4.11.20210226
	SlicerRT extension
	
New Features:
	- Added attribute 'InitialSliceOffset' at the Image level
		- when image is initially loaded, it will be displayed at the offset (in mm) set in the quiz xml file
		- example:
			<Image Type="Volume" ID="MR" RotateToAcquisition="Y" InitialSliceOffset="35.15">
				<DefaultDestination>Yellow</DefaultDestination>
				<Layer>Background</Layer>
				<DefaultOrientation>Coronal</DefaultOrientation>
				<Path>ImageVolumes\BrainTumor1\MRBrainTumor1.nrrd</Path>
			</Image>
	- Added attribute 'ContourVisibility' at the Session level
		- Options: 'Fill' (solid display) or 'Outline' (default)
		- This setting applies to images loaded as a label map as well as a segmentation.

Modifications:
	- XML attribute changes (not backwards compatible with previous versions)
		- new attribute 'InitialSliceOffset' added to Image element



Fix:
	- Reading DICOM images sometimes would load a volume multiple times.
		- Image Quizzer code was modified to load DICOM images using the SOPInstanceUID function.
		  This function takes into account the confidence associated with each Slicer plugin that
		  is available for loading the image and chooses the one with the highest confidence.
